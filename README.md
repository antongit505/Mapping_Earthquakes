# Mapping Earthquakes using JavaScript, D3, Leaflet, Mapbox, HTML & CSS.

We will be working with the Distater Reporting Network, a nonprofit company that provides data driven
story telling on disasters around the world.<br/>
We will build insightful data visualizations with interactive features on earthquakes from around the world.<br/>
The data to be used will be a GeoJSON file from the US Geological Surver website, we will retrieve the data
using JavaScript, d3, leaflet, and plot the information on a Mapbox map through an API request.<br/>
The magnitude and location of earthquake will be shown in a popup marker, the diameter of the marker should
reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color.
